The Vue File Manager (File Explorer) is a graphical user interface component for managing the file system that allows users to perform most common file operations, like accessing, editing, and sorting files or folders. This component provides easy navigation to select a file or folder from the file system. 

It supports rendering flat JSON data objects, eliminating the need for HTTP client requests and back-end URL configuration. All file operations can be handled within the element through file action events. 

The File Manager UI consists of a toolbar, navigation pane, and content pane through which the files or folders in the file system can be accessed and managed. The componentâ€™s entire layout can be customized with features like right-to-left alignment, enabling or disabling the toolbar and navigation pane, and switching between views.
